## WBG310 project/a portfolio
This is my first attempt at a node.js MVC project.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
There's libraries that I'm working with that get loaded from the package.json that have no use here yet, hold tight I guess.

## Usage
Make a directory named "data" that'll store a sqlite database.
```bash
node app.js
```
Maybe you don't need to do this cause I tried to fake git to take an empty dir?


## Changes
Ongoing. It's a WIP

## Todo
Dynamic pages stored in sqlite db.
Admin login/panel.
Move the contacts to said panel.
Pretty up the weather.
Work to be done on the snake game.
Better commenting/documentation.


## License
All my code do whatever with I guess.
